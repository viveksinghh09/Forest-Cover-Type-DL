# Forest CoverType Classification using Deep Neural Networks

A Deep Learning project to classify forest cover types into 7 categories using the UCI Forest CoverType dataset. Implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, this model demonstrates the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), dropout regularization, and early stopping to improve performance on a real-world multi-class classification problem.
